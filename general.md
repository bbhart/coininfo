General Reading
===============

General reading about cryptocurrency and blockchain. Things to think about. Ideally you'd read top down.

On Anonymity
------------
* [Anonymous vs pseudononymous](https://tante.cc/2011/08/12/anonymous-vs-pseudonymous/): on most
of the popular blockchains, you aren't anonymous. You're using a
nickname 
(that looks something like `0x13f2ef50A55D5B3B8A9D9B083b1Ed9F9427cd832`), and it's just not clear (yet) that you go by that nickname.
* [Your Sloppy Bitcoin Drug Deals Will Haunt You For Years](https://www.wired.com/story/bitcoin-drug-deals-silk-road-blockchain/): the problem with a public, immutable, 10 year old blockchain is that it's a public, immutable, 10 year old blockchain. There's a public ledger of every transactions that's ever occurred. It's just a matter of typing your nickname (`0x13f2ef50A55D5B3B8A9D9B083b1Ed9F9427cd832`) into your real name (`David Q. Cokebuyer`).
* U.S. exchanges are required to comply with [Know Your Customer](https://steemit.com/bitcoin/@steemitguide/guide-to-regulating-cryptocurrency-via-the-know-your-customer-procedure-and-compliance) regulations when dealing with larger customers.
* Governments and regulators are getting better at turning nicknames into real names. The [U.S. Internal Revenue Service has requested records on Coinbase users](https://medium.com/@GlobalTaxAccountants/irs-narrows-scope-of-coinbase-subpoena-impact-for-coinbase-users-770532755c5e). This is a big step forward in tying transactions to known entities, as long as the coins stay in an exchange the IRS can subpoena. Buy coins and move them to an overseas exchange, though, and it gets much harder. 
* [Monero](https://www.monero.how/how-does-monero-privacy-work) and similar coins look to provide privacy that the big platforms like Bitcoin and Ethereum weren't designed for.
